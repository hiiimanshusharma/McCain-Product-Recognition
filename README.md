# McCain-Product-Recognition

I designed and implemented a product recognition solution tailored specifically for identifying and categorizing a wide range of products within the McCain Brand. Leveraging advanced computer vision techniques and deep learning algorithms, this system can accurately analyze images and videos to recognize McCain products, distinguishing between different product variants and packaging designs. The solution provides valuable insights for inventory management, marketing, and quality control, enhancing the overall efficiency and performance of McCain's product operations.
